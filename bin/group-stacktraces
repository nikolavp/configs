# A script that groups stacktraces together and gives you the totals amount of
# threads that are at the same position. I find this script valuable when
# debugging systems with thousand of threads. I can see at glance things like:
# 1) Number of threads waiting on a lock
# 2) A method that is clearly a hotspot
# 3) Network contention - If I see many threads waiting on Socket.read
# In simple usage is
